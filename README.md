# About

This is a repository for my miscellaneous projects.



### directory_exploder

takes src and dst dirpath args and copies the contents over from src into dest. Also creates subdirectories to sort by file extension. This part is buggy, and may not be the optimal way to sort files. But that is how it is.



### directory_stats_win

retrieve some statistics from the parsed in src dirpath. When complete may output stats in json or stdout
